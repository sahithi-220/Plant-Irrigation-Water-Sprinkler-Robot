## 📝 Project Description

The **Smart Plant Irrigation & Sprinkler Robot** is designed to automate the watering process in fields or gardens. It senses soil moisture levels and activates a sprinkler system only when necessary. This reduces water wastage and ensures crops receive optimal hydration.

The system continuously reads sensor data and makes real-time decisions using Arduino logic, helping farmers and gardeners save both time and resources.

## ✅ Key Features

- 🌱 **Automated Soil Monitoring**  
  Monitors moisture levels and irrigates only when the soil is dry.

- 🚿 **Intelligent Sprinkler Control**  
  Automatically triggers the water pump based on sensor readings.

- 🔌 **Energy Efficient**  
  Optimized for low power consumption, suitable for remote locations.

- 📈 **Real-time Feedback**  
  Displays sensor data live on LCD or serial monitor.

- ⚙️ **Custom Threshold Setting**  
  Moisture thresholds are adjustable to suit various crops or climates.

- 🧠 **Arduino-Based Logic**  
  Implements simple decision-making using embedded programming.

- 🌍 **Eco-Friendly and Scalable**  
  Encourages water conservation and can be scaled to larger fields.

## 📂 Example Use Case

A farmer places the robot in a paddy field. As the soil dries below a set threshold, the moisture sensor activates the pump, starting irrigation. Once the soil reaches sufficient moisture, the system stops automatically — saving water and reducing manual work.
